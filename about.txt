ABOUT

LKRhythm II is a rhythm game.
I have been working on it for two years-it's really been a long
journey. This may well be the greatest thing I have ever built in
high school. I doubt I've ever spent this much time on anything else.
I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

...it's quite an odd feeling, looking back.

...What does one do now, anyway? Should one be happy?
