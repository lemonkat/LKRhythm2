### LKRhythm II: A Terminal-Based Rhythm Game
#### By LemonKat

This is a small rhythm game I've made, using a terminal display system. Well, it's the second version, the original was kind of a mess.
In a way, this is one of my longest-running projects, as it can trace its lineage to a file in a different game from 3 years ago. 

###### How to Play
to run:
run `python3 game.py`

The menus are navigated only using WASD and space. During gameplay, use WASD to hit notes and space to pause.

###### Hardware
I also built a custom arrow pad out of cardboard and aluminum foil. If you build your own, in the `hardware` directory I have CircuitPython scripts. Simply connect the player to an AdaFruit CPX's GND pin and the 4 arrows to pins A4 through A7, install the `main_code` script and its dependencies, and plug the board into your laptop.
